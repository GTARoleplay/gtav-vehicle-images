<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

After being affiliated with other gaming communities as a developer I decided to try and create my own gamemode from scratch. The plan was however never to start up my own server, but rather release my take on a roleplay gamemode where I could try out things my way. The project is written in C# server-side and JavaScript client-side.
